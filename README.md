# SwimMaker

SwimMaker is a project that I am working on for my Computer Science class. It is a project where I will make a website with GitHub, where swim coaches (or anyone who wants to) can generate a swimming workout. This workout can include all stroke types, drills, and even a way to both export to google docs and a way to print it. This is my first time using GitHub so I guess I'll learn as I go.


# Features

SwimMaker will be able to do many things once I finish it. One of the things it will do is be interactive and have a multitude of options for making swim workouts. It will also have an option to print, export to google docs, and calculate the total distance swam and calories burnt.


# Goals

My goals for this project are to finish at least all the options for each stoke and drill, and be selectable in some sort of workout-like manner. I also plan on having it be able to list itself to show the entire workout, and even export/print it to google docs to easily edit there. I also want to have learned a bit about each of the languages used in coding websites, like JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
